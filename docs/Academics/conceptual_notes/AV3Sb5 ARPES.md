## ARPES study for KV3Sb5
Ref.  [Three-dimensional energy gap and origin of charge-density wave in kagome superconductor KV3Sb5 | Communications Materials](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-022-00255-1)
### Fermi surface

*Figure 1*

- Fig. 1c shows the ARPES-intensity mapping at $E_F$ as a function of $k_x$ and $k_y$ at T = 120 K (above $T_{CDW}$) measured with 114 eV photons which probe the $k_z$ ~ 0 plane of the bulk Brillouin zone
- A circular pocket centered at the Γ point and two (small and large) triangular shaped intensity patterns centered at each K point are resolved, as also visualized in Fig. 1d.

*Figure 2*

- According to the band structure calculations (Fig. 2), they are attributed to the $5p_z$ band of Sb atoms embedded in the kagome lattice plane (Sb1) and the kagome lattice band with mainly the 3d character of V atoms respectively (note that the small and large triangular features have the dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{xz/yz}$ character, respectively).
-  The large triangular feature with the V-$3d_{xz/yz}$ character connects to each other around the M point and forms a large hexagonal FS centered at the Γ point.
- The bright spots around the M point originate from the large [[Density of states]] associated with the saddle-point van Hove singularity in the band dispersion.

### Influence of CDW on FS
#### Normal ARPES
- ARPES intensity mappings at T = 20 K and 120 K (Fig. 1c, e) share several common features such as the Γ-centered electron pocket and the triangular pattern around the K point, a closer look reveals some intrinsic differences between them. For example, the intensity around the M point associated with the saddle point is substantially suppressed at T = 20 K due to the CDW-gap opening. 
- The intensity of triangular pockets is strongly distorted at T = 20 K to show a discontinuous behavior at particular k points (black arrows), in contrast to that at T = 120 K which shows a smooth intensity distribution.
- This indicates the reconstruction of FS due to the strong modulation of band dispersion by the periodic lattice distortion associated with the [[CDW]].

#### Second derivative ARPES 
- Plot of second-derivative ARPES([[ARPES#Second derivative ARPES]]) intensity at T = 20 K in Fig. 1f signifies that the discontinuous intensity distribution (Fig. below) is accompanied by the emergence of a small pocket-like feature near the K point (white dotted ellipse). This pocket is associated with the CDW because it is absent at T = 120 K (Fig. 1d).

## ARPES study for CsV3Sb5
Ref. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 247002 (2020) – CsV3Sb5: A Z2 Topological Kagome Metal with a Superconducting Ground State](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.247002)

- Data collected with differing photon energies did not reveal any appreciable dispersion along $k_z$, consistent with a quasi-2D band structure.
- ARPES data, collected at 50, 80, 100, and 120 K, showed no resolvable change in the band structure when transitioning through the $T^*$ transition.

- The Fermi surface of $CsV_3Sb_5$ display the characteristic hexagonal symmetry and Brillouin zone expected from the underlying kagome lattice.
- A circular electron pocket is at the Brillouin zone center $\bar{\Gamma}$, labelled as the G band. The orbital projection from DFT reveals that the G band has dominant Sb character (see [[AV3Sb5 band structure#Orbital-projected electronic structure of CsV_3Sb_5]]).
