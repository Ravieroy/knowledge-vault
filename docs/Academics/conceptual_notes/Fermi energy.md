# Fermi energy 
---
Fermi energy is a concept in quantum mechanics that usually refers to the energy difference between the highest and lowest occupied single-particle states in a quantum system of non-interacting fermions at absolute zero temperature. It is applied in determining the electrical and thermal characteristics of the solids. It is often used interchangeably with [[Fermi level]], although both the terms are equal at absolute zero temperature, they are different at other temperatures.

The reason for the existence of this energy level is due to [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which states two fermions cannot occupy that same quantum state. So, if a system has more than one fermion, each fermion has a different set of magnetic quantum numbers associated with it. The ==Fermi Temperature==($T_F$) can be defined as the energy of the Fermi level divided by the Boltzmann’s constant. It is also the temperature at which the energy of the electron is equal to the Fermi energy. It is the measure of the electrons in the lower states of energy in metal.
