# Fermi level 
---
!!! tip
	Read this in analogous with the [[Fermi energy]] for complete understanding. 

The highest energy level that an electron can occupy at the absolute zero temperature is known as the **Fermi Level**. The Fermi level lies between the valence band and conduction band because at absolute zero temperature the electrons are all in the lowest energy state. Due to the lack of sufficient energy at 0 Kelvin, the Fermi level can be considered as the sea of fermions (or electrons) above which no electrons exist. The Fermi level changes as the solids are heated and as electrons are added to or withdrawn from the solid.

It determines the probability of electron occupancy at different energy levels. The closer the Fermi level is to the conduction band energy, the easier it will be for electrons in the valence band to transition into the conduction band. It is the energy level which is occupied by the highest electron orbital at 0 Kelvin (absolute zero temperature) and a parameter of the Fermi-Dirac distribution:

$f(E) = \frac{1}{1+e^{(E-E_F)/kT}}$

Where _T_ is the absolute temperature and _k_ is Boltzmann’s constant. This function gives the probability _f(E)_ of an electron to occupy a state with energy _E_. The distribution function value will have to be nonzero in the conduction band for electrical conductivity to be possible.

Impurities and temperature can affect the Fermi level. Introducing impurities to atoms will bring the Fermi level up and when it is brought high enough, part of the tail will go over to the conduction band. This makes it easier for electrons to travel to the conduction band, and thus conductivity will improve. From the distribution function, temperature directly influences how the energy states are occupied. The tail of the function also gets longer and wider at higher temperatures, stretching out to the conduction band.

==It is to be noted that although the probability function has a value in the energy gap, there are no available energy states within the interval (hence energy gap, with zero density of states) and therefore no electrons populate the gap.==

	The Fermi level and [[Fermi energy]] are usually confusing terms and are often used interchangeably to refer to each other. Although both the terms are equal at absolute zero temperature, they are different at other temperatures.
