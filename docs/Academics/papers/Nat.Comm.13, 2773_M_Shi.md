### Idea of the paper 
Study of a compound $AV_6Sb_6$ and $V_6Sb_4$ which are bilayer variants of the well known [[AV3Sb5 family]]. The pressure dependent phase diagram is obtained and is compared with [[AV3Sb5 general properties]]. The idea is to study the phenomena of [[Superconductivity]] in [[AV6Sb6 family]] of compounds. 

### Summary 
[[AV6Sb6 family]] are bilayer compounds of the [[AV3Sb5 family]] which has very rich and interesting properties (read [[AV3Sb5 general properties]]). All the members of the family show close resemblance in properties and electronic structure. While the [[AV6Sb6 DFT]] properties are slightly different from [[AV3Sb5 DFT]] studies, both shows the existence of Dirac nodal lines and emergence of [[Superconductivity]] due to pressure. Here the author suggests that the SC transition appears at the minima of residual resistivity ratio(RRR) implying a structural transition which in this case is from Rhombohedral to Monoclinic. 

[[CsV6Sb6 ARPES]] studies shows confirmation for DFT results as well.
