Electrons in solids can absorb incident photons with energy larger than the work function of the host material, typically a few electronvolts, and escape into the vacuum. These photoemitted electrons, also known as photoelectrons, are collected by an electron analyzer that measures their kinetic energy and momentum. From these measurements, the original band structure is extracted. The electronic band structures directly visualized by ARPES can provide straightforward evidence of the topological characteristics of topological quantum materials(TQMs). The fact that ARPES is sensitive to both bulk and surface electrons makes it possible to obtain a comprehensive understanding of complex bulk and surface electronic structures, such as topological surface states in topological insulators, Dirac and Weyl fermions in bulk states, and the associated surface Fermi arcs. As an ARPES measurement under one photon energy probes the band dispersion along a 2D surface in the 3D momentum space, light sources with tunable photon energy (e.g., a synchrotron radiation light source) are needed to obtain the band structure covering the whole 3D BZ. Scanning the photon energy, the probed 2D surface in the momentum space sweeps through the entire 3D BZ; thus, characteristic electronic features of TQMs in the bulk phase, including the Dirac points and Weyl points that reside at certain momenta in the 3D BZ, can be located and observed. In addition to measuring the electronic states as a function of momentum and energy, I(k, E), thanks to developments in the past couple of decades, ARPES can also explore other degrees of freedom of electrons, including their spin polarization, spatial distribution, and time evolution. Such a complete ARPES measurement [measuring I(k, E, r, s, t), where r, s, and t represent location, spin, and time, respectively] gives the most comprehensive understanding of the electronic states in equilibrium as well as their dynamics.

(a) Simplified depiction of lens modes for a modern analyzer. In angle dispersive mode, electrons of the same emission angle (denoted by color) arrive at the same spatial position on the detector plane. In imaging mode, the real-space position of the electrons is mapped onto the detector, independent of emission angle. The hemispherical analyzer is highly versatile (compatible with both pulsed and continuous radiation, at energies from eV to keV) and offers high angle and energy resolutions with moderate throughput. A schematic of a generic hemispherical analyzer is shown in Fig. (b). It consists of an input lens column, followed by a hemispherical deflector and finally a 2D electron detector. The lens column images the angular distribution of the electrons onto a slit at the entrance of the hemispherical deflector. The deflector consists of two concentric hemispherical electrodes with different electrostatic potentials, resulting in a radial electric field that causes the electrons to undergo elliptical orbits. Thus, electrons with different KE are dispersed along the radial dimension onto the detector. At the same time, the electron position orthogonal to this axis is determined by its emission angle within the window accepted by the slit. The detector therefore records the 2D photocurrent distribution with respect to ( \\(E_{kin}\\) , \\(\\theta_y\\) ). Energy resolutions of the order of 1 meV are routinely obtained. Typical acceptance angles are \\(\\pm\\) 15\u00b0, with resolutions down to\u223c0.1\u00b0.

Second derivative ARPES \u00b6 The second derivative image (SDI) method is widely applied to sharpen dispersive data features in multi-dimensional spectroscopies such as angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Here, the SDI function is represented in Fourier space, where it has the form of a multi-band pass filter. The need for SDI (and related) filters arises when band features are difficult to observe on top of the incoherent background from multiple-scattering events or from other measurement limitations such as when studying a sample domain smaller than the incident photon beam. They are also used to sharpen features and make it easier to trace dispersions by eye. References \u00b6 Photoemission spectroscopy\u2014from early days to recent applications \u2013 F.

Three-dimensional energy gap and origin of charge-density wave in kagome superconductor KV3Sb5 | Communications Materials Abstract Kagome lattices offer a fertile ground to explore exotic quantum phenomena associated with electron correlation and band topology. The recent discovery of superconductivity coexisting with charge-density wave (CDW) in the kagome metals \\(KV_3Sb_5\\) , \\(RbV_3Sb_5\\) , and \\(CsV_3Sb_5\\) suggests an intriguing entanglement of electronic order and superconductivity. However, the microscopic origin of CDW, a key to understanding the superconducting mechanism and its possible topological nature, remains elusive. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of \\(KV_3Sb_5\\) and demonstrate a substantial reconstruction of Fermi surface in the CDW state that accompanies the formation of small three-dimensional pockets. The CDW gap exhibits a periodicity of undistorted Brillouin zone along the out-of-plane wave vector, signifying a dominant role of the in-plane inter-saddle-point scattering to the mechanism of CDW. The characteristics of experimental band dispersion can be captured by first-principles calculations with the inverse star-of-David structural distortion. The present result indicates a direct link between the low-energy excitations and CDW, and puts constraints on the microscopic theory of superconductivity in alkali-metal kagome lattices. Fermi surface \u00b6 Figure 1 Fig. 1c shows the ARPES-intensity mapping at \\(E_F\\) as a function of \\(k_x\\) and \\(k_y\\) at T = 120 K (above \\(T_{CDW}\\) ) measured with 114 eV photons which probe the \\(k_z\\) ~ 0 plane of the bulk Brillouin zone A circular pocket centered at the \u0393 point and two (small and large) triangular shaped intensity patterns centered at each K point are resolved, as also visualized in Fig. 1d. Figure 2 According to the band structure calculations (Fig. 2), they are attributed to the \\(5p_z\\) band of Sb atoms embedded in the kagome lattice plane (Sb1) and the kagome lattice band with mainly the 3d character of V atoms respectively (note that the small and large triangular features have the dominant \\(d_{x^2-y^2}\\) and \\(d_{xz/yz}\\) character, respectively). The large triangular feature with the V- \\(3d_{xz/yz}\\) character connects to each other around the M point and forms a large hexagonal FS centered at the \u0393 point. The bright spots around the M point originate from the large Density of states associated with the saddle-point van Hove singularity in the band dispersion. Influence of CDW on FS \u00b6 Normal ARPES \u00b6 ARPES intensity mappings at T = 20 K and 120 K (Fig. 1c, e) share several common features such as the \u0393-centered electron pocket and the triangular pattern around the K point, a closer look reveals some intrinsic differences between them. For example, the intensity around the M point associated with the saddle point is substantially suppressed at T = 20 K due to the CDW-gap opening. The intensity of triangular pockets is strongly distorted at T = 20 K to show a discontinuous behavior at particular k points (black arrows), in contrast to that at T = 120 K which shows a smooth intensity distribution. This indicates the reconstruction of FS due to the strong modulation of band dispersion by the periodic lattice distortion associated with the CDW .

One can recognize an obvious difference in the intensity distribution between T = 120 K and 20 K in Fig. (h, i). A new holelike band which crosses \\(E_F\\) (indicated by blue circles and lines) appears at T = 20 K in the k region where FS is absent at T = 120 K. Second derivative ARPES \u00b6 Plot of second-derivative ARPES intensity at T = 20 K in Fig. 1f signifies that the discontinuous intensity distribution (Fig. below) is accompanied by the emergence of a small pocket-like feature near the K point (white dotted ellipse). This pocket is associated with the CDW because it is absent at T = 120 K (Fig. 1d). T = 120K > ( \\(T_{CDW}\\) ) T = 20K (< \\(T_{CDW}\\) ) Ref. Electronic nature of charge density wave and electron-phonon coupling in kagome superconductor KV3Sb5 | Nature Communications Abstract The Kagome superconductors \\(AV_3Sb_5\\) (A = K, Rb, Cs) have received enormous attention due to their nontrivial topological electronic structure, anomalous physical properties and superconductivity. Unconventional charge density wave (CDW) has been detected in AV3Sb5. High-precision electronic structure determination is essential to understand its origin. Here we unveil electronic nature of the CDW phase in our high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission measurements on \\(KV_3Sb_5\\) . We have observed CDW-induced Fermi surface reconstruction and the associated band folding. The CDW-induced band splitting and the associated gap opening have been revealed at the boundary of the pristine and reconstructed Brillouin zones. The Fermi surface- and momentum-dependent CDW gap is measured and the strongly anisotropic CDW gap is observed for all the V-derived Fermi surface. In particular, we have observed signatures of the electron-phonon coupling in \\(KV_3Sb_5\\) . These results provide key insights in understanding the nature of the CDW state and its interplay with superconductivity in AV3Sb5 superconductors. Fermi Surface \u00b6 The CDW-related 2 \u00d7 2 lattice reconstruction generates electronic structure reconstruction. ARPES : FS Reconstructed FS Four Fermi surface (FS) sheets can be seen in the figure (left). FS topology is mainly composed of circular electron like pocket around \\(\\bar{\\Gamma}(\\alpha)\\) . A large hexagon-shaped hole-like sheet centered around \\(\\bar{\\Gamma}(\\beta)\\) , a triangular hole-like pocket around \\(\\bar{K}(\\gamma)\\) and a triangular electron-like pocket around \\(\\bar{K}(\\delta)\\) . Figure (right) shows the effect of the 2 \u00d7 2 lattice reconstruction on the Fermi surface as induced by one of the three wavevectors, \\(Q_1\\) . The reconstructed FS is produced by shifting the original lines by the wave vector \\(\\pm Q_1\\) . Under the measurement geometry used, the observed folded bands are mainly from \\(\\pm Q_1\\) , while those from \\(\\pm Q_2\\) and \\(\\pm Q_3\\) are rather weak. The electronic reconstruction is also directly evidenced in the measured band structure(see original paper fig. 2c), in which the band measured along the \\(\\Gamma - M\\) direction coincides with the direction of Q1 wave vector. Signatures of Electron-Phonon coupling \u00b6 The CDW state was first proposed for a one-dimensional chain of atoms with an equal spacing a which is argued to be inherently unstable against the dimerized ground state. It usually involves one band with a half electron filling. This would open a CDW gap at the Fermi point \\(k_F\\) = \u00b1\u03c0/2a and produce a lattice reconstruction with a wavevector of \u03c0/a. Such a Fermi surface nesting picture is extended to real materials with higher dimensions, where the CDW state is realized because segments of the Fermi surface are nearly parallel, connected by a wavevector \\(Q_{CDW}\\) . The CDW transition typically involves electronic structure reconstruction and lattice distortion, in which the electron\u2013phonon coupling plays an important role. The evidence of this Strong coupling approach to CDW has been observed in \\(KV_3Sb_5\\) . Bandstructure(BS) Zoomed BS & Self-Energy A kink in the dispersion can be observed in the above figure. The quantitative dispersion is obtained by fitting momentum distribution curves at different binding energies. Taking a linear line as an empirical bare band, the effective real part of the electron self-energy is shown in Fig. (h). It shows a peak at ~36 meV. The observed kink in the energy dispersion and the peak-dip-hump structure in EDCs (see paper) are reminiscent of those from the electron\u2013boson coupling in simple metal and high-temperature superconductors. The phonon frequency of the vanadium vibrations in AV3Sb5 can reach up to ~36meV, that is consistent with the mode energy observed. Therefore, significant self energy effects in \\(KV_3Sb_5\\) is observed. It can be interpreted in terms of electron\u2013phonon coupling, which is present for all bands.

Also read the common misconception regarding the Fermi level. The Fermi level is the energy (not necessarily corresponding to an actual energy level of the system) at which the occupation probability given by the Fermi-Dirac distribution is 1/2. The Fermi level of a metal at zero temperature is the same as the Fermi energy of that metal. This is not true for insulators, where the Fermi level lies inside the energy gap. If we refer to the Fermi energy as the Fermi level at zero temperature. With this definition, the Fermi energy does not need to coincide with an actual energy level of the system.( See Useful Links ) It determines the probability of electron occupancy at different energy levels. The closer the Fermi level is to the conduction band energy, the easier it will be for electrons in the valence band to transition into the conduction band. It is the energy level which is occupied by the highest electron orbital at 0 Kelvin (absolute zero temperature) and a parameter of the Fermi-Dirac distribution: \\(f(E) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{(E-E_F)/kT}}\\) Where T is the absolute temperature and k is Boltzmann\u2019s constant. This function gives the probability f(E) of an electron to occupy a state with energy E . The distribution function value will have to be nonzero in the conduction band for electrical conductivity to be possible. Impurities and temperature can affect the Fermi level. Introducing impurities to atoms will bring the Fermi level up and when it is brought high enough, part of the tail will go over to the conduction band. This makes it easier for electrons to travel to the conduction band, and thus conductivity will improve. From the distribution function, temperature directly influences how the energy states are occupied. The tail of the function also gets longer and wider at higher temperatures, stretching out to the conduction band. It is to be noted that although the probability function has a value in the energy gap, there are no available energy states within the interval (hence energy gap, with zero density of states) and therefore no electrons populate the gap. Important The Fermi level and Fermi energy are usually confusing terms and are often used interchangeably to refer to each other. Although both the terms are equal at absolute zero temperature, they are different at other temperatures. Position of Fermi level \u00b6 What does it mean when the Fermi level lies in the band gap or instead in one of the bands? Metals : are very good conductors because the Fermi level lies inside one of the bands, meaning there's no energy gap to overcome for an electron in the valence band to pass on to the conduction band. Which explains why metals are populated by quasi-free electrons in the conduction band. Semi-metals : Very similarly to metals, \\(E_F\\) lies in one of the bands, but unlike metals, here the overlap between valence and conduction bands are very small. But still no gap! Semiconductors : For semiconductors, there's a small energy gap between the two valence and conduction bands, the states in the gap are not available to the electrons. So in order to have moving charge carriers, electrons and holes, the system first has to be heated up (excited, also possible with an applied E-field) in order to overcome the gap \\(E_g\\) and be able to occupy the available states in the conduction band. \\(E_F\\) lies in the gap for semiconductors , which means occupied and unoccupied states in valence and conduction band respectively are energetically separated. Insulators : the energy gap between the two bands in so large, that it becomes very difficult to excite electrons towards the conduction band, hence their poor conductivity. Confusing aspects of Fermi Level \u00b6 Frequently, the Fermi level is wrongly defined as the energy of the most energetic occupied electron state in a system.

Also read the common misconception regarding the Fermi level. The Fermi level is the energy (not necessarily corresponding to an actual energy level of the system) at which the occupation probability given by the Fermi-Dirac distribution is 1/2. The Fermi level of a metal at zero temperature is the same as the Fermi energy of that metal. This is not true for insulators, where the Fermi level lies inside the energy gap. If we refer to the Fermi energy as the Fermi level at zero temperature. With this definition, the Fermi energy does not need to coincide with an actual energy level of the system.( See Useful Links ) It determines the probability of electron occupancy at different energy levels. The closer the Fermi level is to the conduction band energy, the easier it will be for electrons in the valence band to transition into the conduction band. It is the energy level which is occupied by the highest electron orbital at 0 Kelvin (absolute zero temperature) and a parameter of the Fermi-Dirac distribution: \\(f(E) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{(E-E_F)/kT}}\\) Where T is the absolute temperature and k is Boltzmann\u2019s constant. This function gives the probability f(E) of an electron to occupy a state with energy E . The distribution function value will have to be nonzero in the conduction band for electrical conductivity to be possible. Impurities and temperature can affect the Fermi level. Introducing impurities to atoms will bring the Fermi level up and when it is brought high enough, part of the tail will go over to the conduction band. This makes it easier for electrons to travel to the conduction band, and thus conductivity will improve. From the distribution function, temperature directly influences how the energy states are occupied. The tail of the function also gets longer and wider at higher temperatures, stretching out to the conduction band. It is to be noted that although the probability function has a value in the energy gap, there are no available energy states within the interval (hence energy gap, with zero density of states) and therefore no electrons populate the gap. Important The Fermi level and Fermi energy are usually confusing terms and are often used interchangeably to refer to each other. Although both the terms are equal at absolute zero temperature, they are different at other temperatures.","title":"Fermi level"},{"location":"Academics/conceptual_notes/Fermi%20level/#position-of-fermi-level","text":"What does it mean when the Fermi level lies in the band gap or instead in one of the bands? Metals : are very good conductors because the Fermi level lies inside one of the bands, meaning there's no energy gap to overcome for an electron in the valence band to pass on to the conduction band. Which explains why metals are populated by quasi-free electrons in the conduction band. Semi-metals : Very similarly to metals, \\(E_F\\) lies in one of the bands, but unlike metals, here the overlap between valence and conduction bands are very small. But still no gap! Semiconductors : For semiconductors, there's a small energy gap between the two valence and conduction bands, the states in the gap are not available to the electrons. So in order to have moving charge carriers, electrons and holes, the system first has to be heated up (excited, also possible with an applied E-field) in order to overcome the gap \\(E_g\\) and be able to occupy the available states in the conduction band. \\(E_F\\) lies in the gap for semiconductors , which means occupied and unoccupied states in valence and conduction band respectively are energetically separated. Insulators : the energy gap between the two bands in so large, that it becomes very difficult to excite electrons towards the conduction band, hence their poor conductivity.","title":"Position of Fermi level"},{"location":"Academics/conceptual_notes/Fermi%20level/#confusing-aspects-of-fermi-level","text":"Frequently, the Fermi level is wrongly defined as the energy of the most energetic occupied electron state in a system.

Important This feature strongly indicates that the structural transition plays an important role in this CDW transition.

Photoelectron spectrometers work by ionizing samples using high-energy radiation (such as UV or x-rays) and then measuring the kinetic energies (KE\\text{KE}KEstart text, K, E, end text) of the ejected electrons. A PES spectrum is a graph of photoelectron count vs. binding energy . The peaks in a PES spectrum correspond to electrons in different subshells of an atom. The peaks with the lowest binding energies correspond to valence electrons, while the peaks with higher binding energies correspond to core electrons.","title":"Photoelectron spectroscopy"},{"location":"Academics/conceptual_notes/Plasma%20oscillation/","text":"Plasma Oscillation \u00b6 If you had a neutral plasma (which can be the free charges in a metal) and you pulled the negative and positive charges apart and let them go, they would oscillate due to the electrostatic potential.

It seemed of only academic significance, however, since there are no strictly one-dimensional systems in nature. I therefore did not think it worth publishing the argument, beyond a brief remark in the book, which did not even mention the logarithmic behavior. Peierls RE (1991) More Surprises in Theoretical Physics (Princeton Univ Press, Princeton), p 29. Motivation \u00b6 The traditional approach to explaining CDW involves the Fermi surface nesting which originally was formulated for 1D systems where Peierls Transition created a fundamental instability. The conjecture was that the gain in electronic energy would always overwhelm the cost of restructuring the atoms. The phonon dispersion for a 1D chain showed Kohn anomaly below and equal to the transition temperature \\(T_{CDW}\\) . The standard practice to extend the Peierls picture to higher dimensions is to calculate the susceptibility ( \\(\\chi(\\vec{q},\\omega)\\) ) for a given electronic configuration and use the zero energy value of the Lindhard response function \\(\\chi_0(\\vec{q}) \\equiv \\chi_0(\\vec{q},\\omega=0)\\) to determine whether the electron response can drive a Peierls phase transition\u2015there should be a peak in the imaginary part of the response function \\(Im[\\chi_0(\\vec{q})]\\) at the Fermi surface nesting (FSN) vector \\(q_{CDW}\\) as well as in the real part \\(Re[\\chi_0(\\vec{q})]\\) , because the real part defines the stability of the system. Important If CDWs are created by FSN, the Fermi contour must have been distorted to create nesting as represented by \\(Re[\\chi_0(\\vec{q})]\\) . In a seminal paper, Johannes and Mazin demonstrated that the logarithmic divergence of \\(Re[\\chi_0(\\vec{q})]\\) is not robust against small deviations from perfect nesting. The dotted line in Fig. (D) illustrates what happens for only a 2% deviation in \\(k_F\\) from perfect nesting and Fig. (D), Inset, shows the effect of including a small \u201cDrude relaxation\u201d in the calculation for the susceptibility. If FSN is the origin of the CDW as in the Peierls picture, the real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility calculated using the measured band structure should both show strong peaks at \\(q_{CDW}\\) , there should be a Kohn anomaly in all the phonons (except ones not allowed by symmetry) at \\(q_{CDW}\\) , and at least one of the modes must go imaginary at low temperature, inducing a lattice distortion and an electronic gap. Note One may argue that both FSN and EPC are forms of electron\u2013lattice interaction, involving excitations of electrons from filled to empty states. However, they should be distinguished because FSN involves elastic scattering, whereas EPC involves inelastic scattering from the lattice. Density functional theory calculations were performed for a 1D chain of Na atoms, which should be the best representation of a perfect Peierls system. With the atoms clamped there was no sign of an electronic-only density wave, and relaxation of the ion position in the 1D chain failed to produce any distortion, i.e., no Peierls distortion. However, if the ions were allowed to move in 2D, the lowest energy state was a zigzag chain, but the electronic gap anticipated in the Peierls CDW phase was missing. How do we know if EPC is strong enough to drive the charge ordering? YBCO could be an apt example to answer this question. Recent phonon measurements (See References ) show signatures of strong EPC in the low-temperature (below 150 K) charge-ordering phase of YBCO. However, the role of EPC in YBCO is substantially different from the role in \\(NbSe_2\\) due to two aspects: 1. No phonon softening was observed above 150 K ( \\(T_{CDW}\\) ) and 2. The energy of the soft phonon modes never approaches zero. Thus, EPC is not strong enough in cuprates to drive the formation of the CO or CDW phase. What is EPC mechanism? \u00b6 The strong- coupling approach views the CDW as a condensate out of a pre-formed excitonic liquid of bad metals. The unconventional CDW found in the parent dichalcogenide is a bose-condensate of pre-formed excitons from high temperature.

Polaritons \u00b6 Polaritons are quasiparticles that exist when an EM mode is strongly coupled to some other type of mode , i.e., if we have light strongly coupled to some other physical excitation then the particle picture is inaccurate if we treat the 2 degrees of freedom separately (because particle number is not conserved).

By using real-space self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes calculations and momentum-space calculations involving density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory, it is shown that there is a surprising reappearance of superconductivity in the presence of non-magnetic disorder fluctuations. Summary \u00b6 Superconductivity and CDW are considered weak coupling Fermi surface instabilities mediated by phonons. These orders compete for the same Fermi surface and when disorder suppresses one, the other one grows at its expense. The original idea of CDW due to Fermi surface nesting ( Peierls Transition ) do not appear in real system where nesting is scarce. An alternative view is from strong coupling. Large spectral weight transfer and absence of phonon signatures at typical energies in ARPES data, along with momentum-independent self-energy, are strong pointers to physics beyond(mean-field) single particle processes. In order to understand the competition, the problem of co-existing CDW and SC is taken, and a non-magnetic disorder is added to it. Two kinds of disorders are studied: random disorder and clusters of disordered regions of fixed strengths. Using BdG Theory formulation, the evolution of SC and CDW is observed by Monte Carlo method. A DFT followed by multi-orbital DMFT calculations has been done. Results from self-consistent BdG calculations \u00b6 Emergence of superconducting islands increases with increasing disorder even though the disorder is completely uncorrelated from site to site. These superconducting islands are separated from one another by very small CDW regions and the size of the islands is the measure of coherence length and can be tuned with disorder strength and superconducting pair potential. variation of \\(\\Delta_{CDW}\\) and \\(\\Delta_{SC}\\) with disorder strength in (a) clustered disorder configuration, and (b) random disorder configuration. \\(\\Delta_{CDW}\\) decreases with disorder strength, while the SC order increases, indicating that emergence of SC order takes place in a highly disordered situation. For longer CDW wavelength, SC is not suppressed much (or by negligible amount) by CDW in the absence of disorder, because the density modulation due to CDW takes place over a length scale which does not affect SC. If CDW has a small wave vector (i.e., rapidly changing carrier density) SC is strongly affected. Suppression of the superconductivity by the CDW order decreases with increasing CDW period (or decreasing the values of \\(Q_x\\) and \\(Q_y\\) ). The reentrance of superconductivity in the presence of nonmagnetic potential fluctuation, extracted in analysis of a square lattice, is expected to be present in a triangular lattice also.

Similar features are observed for the doped TaSe2. Six hole pockets are observed in the Fermi surface for both the structure. DMFT \u00b6 The parent compound 2H-TaSe2 has two CDW transitions (120 K and 90 K) down to low temperatures and the reported superconductivity is below 1 K( \\(\\sim 0.14 K\\) ) Examination of CDW state through resistivity in this dichalcogenide shows a change in slope of resistivity around 120 K in 2H-TaSe2, which is the onset of incommensurate CDW. DMFT resistivity with temperature for x=0 and x=1 The resistivity decreases monotonically thereafter without any feature. The onset of commensurate CDW order at 90 K does not reflect in the resistivity, as the condensation of pre-formed excitons already began at a higher temperature. Below 5 K, the resistivity suddenly drops sharply to a very small value, indicating the onset of an SC transition at 5 K in the x = 1 alloy. Strong coupling route \u00b6 An effective model for the incoherent metal is written down and a mean field analysis for the CDW instability is performed thereon. The partial restoration of coherence in the low temperature phase is achieved through excitonic condensation. The resistivity above the instabilities, tellingly, reflects this excitonic fluctuation with a linear behavior at high temperature until CDW or SC order sets in. Disorder brings in a new length scale in the problem and degrades CDW order by localizing charges and suppressing excitonic fluctuations. Superconductivity is not affected by disorder, unless it is too strong. This is primarily the reason why SC shows up at the expense of CDW as disorder increases. This also implies that the resistivity actually goes down with disorder initially (till disorder-induced charge localization comes into effect) in the CDW state, seen in DMFT calculations.","title":"EPJ.B,93,77(2020) Sudipta Koley"},{"location":"Academics/papers/EPJ.B%2C93%2C77%282020%29_Sudipta_Koley/#charge-density-wave-and-superconductivity-in-transition-metal-dichalcogenides","text":"Journal Ref.

Here the author suggests that the SC transition appears at the minima of residual resistivity ratio(RRR) implying a structural transition which in this case is from Rhombohedral to Monoclinic. CsV6Sb6 ARPES studies shows confirmation for DFT results as well.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"Academics/papers/PNAS.1424791112_X_Zhu/","text":"Classification of charge density waves based on their nature \u00b6 Journal Ref. pnas.1424791112 Keywords \u00b6 CDW Strong Coupling Fermi surface nesting Idea of the paper \u00b6 Failure of traditional approach to CDW in real systems.

The paper discusses the motivation behind the Strong coupling approach to CDW and briefly describes the Experimental Methods to analyze CDW . To illustrate the importance of EPC in the formation of CDW, the widely studied system \\(NbSe_2\\) has been described.

The absence of FSN can be seen in the real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility \\(\\chi_0(\\vec{q})\\) plotted from the experimental data in the \u0393\u2013M direction in Fig. (B) and (C).

Fig.(G) displays the measured resistivity as a function of temperatures, clearly showing the superconducting phase transition at \\(T_S\\) but almost no change at the CDW transition temperature \\(T_{CDW}\\) . There is no gap in the electronic system, i.e., no insulating state associated with the low-temperature CDW state, inconsistent with that predicted by the Peierls model. Momentum dependent EPC \u00b6 The \\(\\vec{q}\\) -dependent EPC is described by the matrix element \\({|g(\\vec{k},\\vec{k^\\prime})|}^2\\) that couples electronic states \\(\\vec{k}\\) and \\(\\vec{k^\\prime}\\) with a phonon of wave vector \\(\\vec{q}=\\vec{k}-\\vec{k^\\prime}\\) and energy \\(\\hbar \\omega\\) . Making the assumption \\({|g(\\vec{k},\\vec{k^\\prime})|}^2 = {|g(\\vec{q})|}^2\\) , \\(\\Gamma_{EPC}(\\vec{q}) = -2{|g(\\vec{q})|}^2 Im[\\chi(\\omega,\\vec{q})]\\) Where, \\(\\Gamma_{EPC}(\\vec{q})\\) is the phonon linewidth. The interacting susceptibility \\(Im[\\chi(\\omega,\\vec{q})\\) carries the information from both electron\u2013phonon and electron\u2013electron interactions. Note Read the paper for more explanation for this part. Experimentally it is not feasible to obtain the interacting \\(Im[\\chi(\\omega,\\vec{q})]\\) and hence authors used an alternative approach. They used the measured band structure which contains both electron-phonon and electron-electron coupling as the input to calculate the Lindhard response function \\(Im[\\chi_0(\\omega =0,\\vec{q})] = Im[\\chi_0(\\vec{q})]\\) (see Fig.(C)) The strong Kohn-like anomaly observed in 2H- \\(NbSe_2\\) arises from the \\(\\vec{q}\\) -dependent EPC matrix element with a peak at \\(\\vec{q}_{CDW}\\) , not from the conventional FSN in the electronic structure. What happens in systems with large EPC like cuprates? Cuprates display different kind of charge ordering(CO) such as stripe phase, a checkerboard phase, special kind of short-range CO phase and long range CO or CDW s. There is competition between these phases and poses interesting problems. Several works (see References ) show that simple Fermi surface nesting is not the driving force of EPC and also that phonon measurements show strong EPC in the low temperature (below 150K) regime. Unlike the case in 2D layered materials like \\(NbSe_2\\) , neither FSN nor EPC is directly relevant to the CO or CDW phases in cuprates. A recent STM study demonstrated that the observed modulations of the electronic structure in cuprates are unconventional density waves, where antiferromagnetic and Coulomb interactions may play a key role. In any case, whatever the CO phase in cuprates is, it is not a conventional CDW. In the Fig.(D) above, we see a peak in \\(Re[\\chi(\\vec{q},0)]\\) at q \u223c \\(0.41 \u00c5^{\u22121}\\) and from this we might argue that this system would support a CDW, but there is no peak in \\(Re[\\chi(\\vec{q},80 \\text{ meV})]\\) at this momentum. Fig. (D), Inset, shows \\(Im[\\chi(\\vec{q},80 \\text{ meV})]\\) with a peak at q \u223c \\(0.18 \u00c5^{\u22121}\\) , which is also present in \\(Re[\\chi(\\vec{q},80 \\text{ meV})]\\) , indicating that there could be a Kohn-like anomaly in the \\(A_{1g}\\) phonon branch at this q. However, nothing is seen in the phonon dispersion or linewidth at this small q. It illustrates that although the shape of the susceptibility function is important for determining the characteristics of \\({|g(\\vec{k},\\vec{k^\\prime})|}^2\\) , it appears to have little predictive power when it comes to predicting the existence of or the characteristic of a CDW. Classification of CDW \u00b6 Type I : Type I CDWs are quasi-1D systems with their origin in the Peierls instability (FSN). Here the lattice distortion is a secondary effect and results from the electronic disturbance. The best example may be linear chain compounds. Type II : Type II CDWs are driven by EPC, but not by FSN. Here the electronic and lattice instabilities are intimately tied to each other, and there is a phonon mode at \\(q_{CDW}\\) going to zero at the transition temperature \\(T_{CDW}\\) . There is no reason to have a metal-insulator transition associated with the transition. Type II CDWs have been described in this paper. Type III : Type III CDWs are systems where there is a charge modulation (or CO) with no indication of FSN or EPC as the driving force. The best example of type III CDWs may be the cuprates that exhibit CO phenomena. Strong EPC or FSN may exist in those systems, but there is no clear signature that EPC or FSN is essential to the formation of the CDWs.

Size and Orientation \u00b6 Check the size of the poster allowed. e.g., 90 cm (W) x 210 cm (H) is suitable for portrait posters up to A0 size Choose the layout: Portrait or Landscape. In LibreOffice Impress, go to Slide > Slide Properties to change the slide width and height. 48\" x 36\" poster in landscape orientation could be used. 2. Content and Layout \u00b6 Abstract and poster title is to be submitted beforehand and from here we can begin the creation of poster. We can start things manually, or we can take some template and use that. Some common layouts are shown in the figure below. Some common practices - Posters should have subsections with short sentences, and in bullet points. - Order of the section goes from top to bottom and left to right. - Simple is good - Make important information stand out. - Line things up. - Don\u2019t make it crowded. 3.

Images \u00b6 Use images as main source to convey the idea and properly mention the source. Again, use high quality images or vector images. Zoom the figure to 100% to see how it will look when printed 5. Fonts \u00b6 It is good practice to use only 2 to 3 fonts in the poster. The two main font type that can be used are Serif and Sans Serif . Difference Examples Use Non-serif fonts for title and sub-heading and Serif fonts for main body of the text. The following picture could be a guide to set the font size of the text in the poster. ![poster-font-sizes.png](../assets/poster-font-sizes.png) 6. Colors \u00b6 It is best to choose a light background with the darker text. The reverse could be done for the title and the sub-heading, i.e., darker background and light text. We can use color for the bullet points and have thick color borders. 7. Line up the content \u00b6 Everything should be of right size and should be aligned correctly. The grid lines can help with the alignment. 8. Save as PDF \u00b6 The poster should be exported as PDF after finalizing all the changes.","title":"Steps to make an academic poster"},{"location":"Academics/poster/Steps%20to%20make%20an%20academic%20poster/#steps-to-make-an-academic-poster","text":"Scientific Poster Design and Layout | Fonts, Colors, Contrasts, Screen vs. Print | MakeSigns","title":"Steps to make an academic poster"},{"location":"Academics/poster/Steps%20to%20make%20an%20academic%20poster/#1-size-and-orientation","text":"Check the size of the poster allowed. e.g., 90 cm (W) x 210 cm (H) is suitable for portrait posters up to A0 size Choose the layout: Portrait or Landscape.

template, follow the next steps. For a more minimal approach, follow jobindj's Template . Features of this vault \u00b6 get the Obsidian/Roam style [[wikilinks]] from your vault in your published notes Toggle between light and dark mode Supports LaTeX, admonition style and all the basic Markdown syntax. Quick start \u00b6 Step 1 : On GitHub, click the \"fork\" button on the top right of this repository's main page. Step 2 : Give a name to your repository. By default, your notes will be published at <https://username.github.io/repo-name/> Step 3 : Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the command git clone repo_url Step 4 : Go to Settings > Pages and select the Source as your gh-pages branch. Once above steps are done, wait for a couple of minutes or so for the website to build. You should see the following in your settings > Pages and you can check if your website which looks like mine right now is build or not. Tip Even if it is not showing the website, do not worry, we will fix that later by re-initializing the repository from our local terminal. Configuring your website \u00b6 There are several files that contain references to this repository's name and URL, which is different to the new forked repository URL, since the username and the repository name might have changed. Also, you would like your notes to be shown in your website instead of mine. Tip We will make the changes locally and then push the changes to GitHub, but remember that, you can do everything from the website as well. Enter into your newly forked repository, where you should see the similar folder structure as in this repository now. docs : This will contain the folders which contains your notes in Markdown format, which will then appear on your website. For example, I have two folders which Academics and LinuxStuffs which has notes that you see on the website. Put your own notes after removing things related to my website index.md : This is stored in docs folder, and it is your homepage. Edit it according to your choice. javascripts : Do not delete this folder as it contains the code required for LaTeX support on the website Misc : This folder can be deleted as it is catering to my workflow. LiCENSE : This contains the license. mkdocs.yml : This is the most important file for this website, and it contains everything needed to customize and build the mkdocs pages. Try to not tamper with options which you might feel uncomfortable with. Having said that, we will edit this file for customizations later. README.md : This is the README file for this repository. Edit it accordingly. requirements.txt : This file contains all the dependencies required to build the website locally. You will need Python and pip installed in your system. Build website locally before deployment In order to be able to build your site, some Python dependencies are needed. You can install them by running, pip install -r requirements.txt Removing the old commits A way of doing so is removing the .git folder and re-initializing the repository. Within the repository directory, do the following steps one by one. rm -rf .git git init git config user.name { user } git config user.email { email } git remote add origin { your repo url } git add . git commit -m \"Initial commit\" git push --force --set-upstream origin master # Force push Now, your website should be up within a couple of minutes. Start making changes according to your needs. To build your website locally, simply use the following command(in the repo directory which contains the mkdocs.yml file) mkdocs serve Then you will get a prompt in your terminal saying your website is hosted at 127.0.0.1:8000/ or something like this. You can open this link in your browser and your website will be visible there. You can see the changes to your website quickly here. Customizing your website For this, we will edit the mkdocs.yml file. Since we will be making changes a lot, start the local build of your website and then make the changes. Saving the changes will build your website in a couple of seconds. Finally, when you are satisfied, you can push the changes to GitHub. Most of the fields are self-explanatory, and hence I will explain only a few of them. The section on features is the one you can play with while building locally. Uncomment the features you want to see or remove. For example, navigation.tabs will create a tabbed layout like a browser. If you do not like it, just comment it out. The section on palette can also be configured to change the look of the website. You can change the colors for light/dark mode here by changing the primary and accent subsections. The features of Markdown like highlighting using (=), underlining using a caret(^) is set up in markdown_extensions section. Finally, the last section on extra can be used to set up social media links. You should definitely edit this part. Tip You should definitely checkout Getting started - Material for MkDocs for features and stuffs.","title":"Forking this vault"},{"location":"Misc/Forking%20this%20vault/#forking-this-vault","text":"If you want to create your own page using my template, follow the next steps.

Another set of notes are related to Linux, which contains general stuffs related to Linux. I made it to note down how certain things are done, how to get rid of certain errors, etc. How are notes arranged? Following the modular approach of Linux, I have tried to make atomic notes, which means every note is small and mostly self-contained. One can start with any notes and then follow around by using the links in them. How to use this? This is to be read on the web format. The best way to read is to go to the homepage of each section, where a mildly curated list is present. Choose your desired topic and then follow the links or come back to the homepage. Linux related stuffs can be found in the folder LinuxStuffs and the mildly curated list can be seen at Linux Homepage . The notes I have been preparing for my studies and research can be found in Academics and a curated list can be found at Academic Notes Homepage . Who am I?
